# GhostMode Brand Guidelines

> "Apple polish. Discord soul. Notion memory. iMessage reborn."

## Core Brand Identity

GhostMode isn't just an app. It's a *living group presence*. It feels native to iOS, *but cooler*. Designed for friends, not contacts. Elegant enough for Apple. Fun enough for Gen Z. Smart enough to feel invisible.

> Think: Apple's Messages, if it were reimagined today—minimal, dark-native, vibe-reactive, and memory-aware.

## Three Foundational Pillars

### 1. APPLE — *Polish, Precision, Presence*

**Design Traits:**
- Silence in design → negative space, no visual noise
- Motion with intent → soft transitions, no hard pops
- Trust through materiality → clean layering, subtle depth, confident simplicity

**Implementation:**
- Glassmorphic UI panels with subtle gradients
- Ultra-clean sans-serif font system (e.g., Satoshi, Inter)
- Minimalist bottom nav, gesture-driven interactions
- White icons with glow (line-based, rounded)

> Apple is the foundation. GhostMode should feel inevitable.

### 2. DISCORD — *Culture, Chaos, Community*

**Design Traits:**
- Shared ownership → Ghost belongs to the group
- Built-in fun → avatars, reactions, inside jokes
- Vibe-responsive visuals → color + behavior change with group energy

**Implementation:**
- Chat aura: interface shifts based on group vibe (chill, chaotic, tense)
- Avatars animate subtly during conversation
- Reactions, stickers, meme generators = culture-on-demand
- Ghost persona responds with tone, not just text

> Discord is the soul. GhostMode doesn't just serve—it *hangs out*.

### 3. NOTION — *Memory, Modularity, Control*

**Design Traits:**
- Memory as object → thoughts = blocks = browseable
- Structure breeds calm → whitespace, timeline, pins
- User governance → let users choose what's remembered

**Implementation:**
- Horizontal memory bar: scrollable chips (plans, jokes, "remember when")
- Timeline view (like Notion calendar) for key conversation moments
- Editable, taggable, pinnable memory cards
- Ghost learns group patterns, not just facts

> Notion is the brain. GhostMode remembers *your story*.

## System-Wide Aesthetic

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Backgrounds** | Deep black with soft animated textures (mist, aura, particles) |
| **UI Cards** | Rounded glassmorphic panels, glow accents, stacked depth |
| **Color Accents** | Based on group mood: coral = friendly, teal = smart, violet = chaotic, gold = serious |
| **Fonts** | Clean sans-serif default (Satoshi/Inter); optional playful swaps per ghost persona |
| **Avatars** | Ghost-style but elegant—think Ghibli meets iOS system icons |
| **Transitions** | Framer Motion-style fluidity: hover magnetic, ghost glides in, feedback shimmers |

## Modern App Design Principles (2025-Forward)

- **Dark Mode Native**: Ghost lives in the dark. Light mode is a feature, not a default.
- **Micro-emotional UI**: Every tap has feedback—shimmer, pulse, glow
- **No Top Navigation**: Bottom nav or gestures only. iOS-native feel.
- **Modular Persona Engine**: Ghost is a personality layer, not just a function
- **Invisible AI**: No "powered by GPT" banners. Ghost just *is*

## Brand Voice & Tone

- **Casual but not sloppy** - Friendly, conversational, but still polished
- **Playful but not childish** - Witty, not silly; clever, not random
- **Smart but not pretentious** - Helpful without being condescending
- **Personalized but not invasive** - Contextual without being creepy

## Visual Identity Guidelines

### Logo & App Icon
- Minimalist ghost silhouette with subtle glow effect
- Dark background with accent color aura
- Clean, recognizable shape that works at small sizes

### Typography Hierarchy
- Headings: Satoshi Bold, generous leading
- Body: Inter Regular, comfortable line height
- UI Elements: System font (SF Pro) for native feel
- Special Elements: Custom typeface for Ghost persona variations

### Iconography
- Line-based icons with consistent stroke width
- Rounded corners and terminals
- Minimal detail, maximum clarity
- Subtle glow effects on interactive elements

## Summary

**GhostMode is what happens when:**
- Apple rebuilds iMessage for modern group dynamics
- Discord injects culture and chaos
- Notion turns chat into a living memory bank

**Outcome:**
A sleek, living, expressive app that feels like part of your group.
> It looks premium. Feels alive. Remembers what matters.
