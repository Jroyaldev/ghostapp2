# GhostMode App

> "iMessage reimagined by Apple in 2025 if they built for Gen Z group chats instead of SMS history."

GhostMode is a next-generation messaging app that combines the polish of Apple, the cultural vibrancy of Discord, and the memory capabilities of Notion to create a unique group chat experience.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the mockup and development files for the GhostMode app, an Expo/React Native application designed to revolutionize group messaging with AI-enhanced features, a beautiful glassmorphic UI, and memory-aware conversations.

## Design Philosophy

GhostMode is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **APPLE** - Sleek, Silent, Premium: Visual silence, polish & materiality, confidence in simplicity
2. **DISCORD** - Culture, Vibe, Expression: Community-first identity, playful customization, vibe-reactive UI
3. **NOTION** - Structure, Memory, Modularity: Tile-based memory, beautiful whitespace, user-defined control

## Getting Started

This project was created with Expo CLI on April 12, 2025.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Project Vision

GhostMode isn't just an app. It's a *living group presence*. It should launch like it was made by Apple, vibe like your funniest friend, and remember like Notion with a soul.
